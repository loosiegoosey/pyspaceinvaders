# Python Space Invaders

## Overview
Python Space Invaders is a classic arcade game implemented in Python. The game involves a player controlling a spaceship at the bottom of the screen, moving left and right to shoot at descending alien invaders. The objective is to eliminate all the invaders before they reach the bottom.

## Features
- Classic Space Invaders gameplay
- Collision detection between the player and invaders/lasers
- Configuration file for customizable settings
- Exception handling for robust error management
- Localization support for multiple languages
- Classes for game text rendering, objects management, and window operations

## Installation Instructions
To install and run Python Space Invaders on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Yuriy/pyspaceinvaders.git
   cd pyspaceinvaders
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies. The project uses `pygame` for rendering the game:

   ```bash
   pip install pygame
   ```

4. Run the game:

   ```bash
   python pyspaceinvaders.py
   ```

## Usage Examples

### Running the Game
After installing the necessary dependencies, you can start the game with:

```bash
python pyspaceinvaders.py
```

### Example Snippet
Here is how you can import and utilize the collision detection module:

```python
from pyspaceinvaders_collision import detect_collision

# Example usage of collision detection
if detect_collision(player_laser, alien):
    alien.destroy()
```

## Code Summary
The code is organized into various Python files, each handling specific aspects of the game:

- **pyspaceinvaders.py**: The main entry point of the game.
